Name                             : mksh
Version                          : 52c-1
Description                      : mksh is the MirBSD enhanced version of the Public Domain Korn\\ shell (pdksh), a Bourne-compatible shell which is largely si-\\ milar to the original AT&T Korn shell; mksh is the only pdksh\\ derivate currently being actively developed. It includes bug\\ fixes and feature improvements, in order to produce a modern,\\ robust shell good for interactive and especially script use.\\ mksh has UTF-8 support (in substring operations and the Emacs\\ editing mode) and - while R50 corresponds to OpenBSD 5.5-cur-\\ rent ksh (without GNU bash-like PS1 and fancy character clas-\\ ses) - adheres to SUSv4 and is much more robust. The code has\\ been cleaned up and simplified, bugs fixed, standards compli-\\ ance added, and several enhancements (for extended compatibi-\\ lity to other modern shells - as well as a couple of its own)\\ are available. It has sensible defaults as usual with BSD.\\  \\ # max. 1kB
