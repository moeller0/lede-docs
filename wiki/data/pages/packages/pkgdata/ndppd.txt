Name                             : ndppd
Version                          : 0.2.3-1
Description                      : ndppd, or NDP Proxy Daemon, is a daemon that proxies NDP (Neighbor Discovery\\ Protocol) messages between interfaces. ndppd currently only supports Neighbor\\ Solicitation Messages and Neighbor Advertisement Messages.\\  \\ The ndp_proxy provided by Linux doesn't support listing proxies, and only hosts\\ are supported. No subnets. ndppd solves this by listening for Neighbor\\ Solicitation messages on an interface, then query the internal interfaces for\\ that target IP before finally sending a Neighbor Advertisement message.\\  \\ # max. 1kB
