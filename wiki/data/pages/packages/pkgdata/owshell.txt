Description                      : OWFS is a suite of programs that designed to make the 1-wire bus and its\\ devices easily accessible. The underlying principle is to create a virtual\\ filesystem, with the unique ID being the directory, and the individual\\ properties of the device are represented as simple files that can be read\\ and written.\\  \\ Details of the individual slave or master design are hidden behind a\\ consistent interface. The goal is to provide an easy set of tools for a\\ software designer to create monitoring or control applications. There are\\ some performance enhancements in the implementation, including data caching,\\ parallel access to bus masters, and aggregation of device communication.\\ Still the fundemental goal has been ease of use, flexibility and correctness\\ rather than speed.\\  \\ This package contains the OWFS shell utilities.\\  \\ # max. 1kB
