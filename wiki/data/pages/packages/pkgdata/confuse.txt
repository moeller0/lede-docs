Name                             : confuse
Version                          : 2.7-1
Description                      : libConfuse is a configuration file parser library, licensed under the\\ terms of the ISC license, and written in C. It supports sections and\\ (lists of) values (strings, integers, floats, booleans or other\\ sections), as well as some other features (such as single/double-quoted\\ strings, environment variable expansion, functions and nested include\\ statements). It makes it very easy to add configuration file capability\\ to a program using a simple API.\\  \\ The goal of libConfuse is not to be the configuration file parser\\ library with a gazillion of features. Instead, it aims to be easy to use\\ and quick to integrate with your code. libConfuse was called libcfg\\ before, but was changed to not confuse with other similar libraries.\\  \\ # max. 1kB
