Name                             : kmod-rtl8xxxu
Version                          : see kernel for details
Description                      : This is an alternative driver for various Realtek RTL8XXX\\ parts written to utilize the Linux mac80211 stack.\\ The driver is known to work with a number of RTL8723AU,\\ RL8188CU, RTL8188RU, RTL8191CU, and RTL8192CU devices\\  \\ This driver is under development and has a limited feature\\ set. In particular it does not yet support 40MHz channels\\ and power management. However it should have a smaller\\ memory footprint than the vendor drivers and benetifs\\ from the in kernel mac80211 stack.\\  \\ It can coexist with drivers from drivers/staging/rtl8723au,\\ drivers/staging/rtl8192u, and drivers/net/wireless/rtlwifi,\\ but you will need to control which module you wish to load.\\  \\ RTL8XXXU_UNTESTED is enabled\\ This option enables detection of Realtek 8723/8188/8191/8192 WiFi\\ USB devices which have not been tested directly by the driver\\ author or reported to be working by third parties.\\  \\ Please report your results!\\  \\ # max. 1kB
