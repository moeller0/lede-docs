===== Before updating availability status =====

  * First, try to find [[wiki:maintenance:eol_devices|official EOL information at the OEM]] (only few OEMs have good data on this subject).
  * If that's not available, try to find the device at different major suppliers in different countries
    * google model-name of the device and see if some well known supplier pops up
    * amazon [[https://www.amazon.de/|de]] / [[https://www.amazon.co.uk/|uk]] / [[https://www.amazon.com/|com]]
  * If that leads to no result, try
    * ebay [[http://www.ebay.de/|de]] [[http://www.ebay.com/|com]] / [[http://www.banggood.com/|banggood]] / [[https://www.aliexpress.com/|aliexpress]] / [[http://www.dx.com/|dx.com]]
    * .de: [[https://www.conrad.de/|conrad]] / [[https://www.voelkner.de/|v√∂lkner]] / [[http://www.reichelt.de/|reichelt]] / [[http://www.pollin.de/shop/index.html|pollin]]
    * other local well known suppliers.

  * Don't care about "sold only in US/EU/CN/...". If the device is available $somewhere, it is available.
  * If a device is available in 2017 at any of the above suppliers (or any other supplier found via simple google search) in quantities and in new condition, i.e. not a single used one on ebay, then it is "Available 2017".
  * If it is available, please state in the //Edit summary// where  (only domain, not the full url), e.g. "Available 2017 at amazon.com".
  * If you can't buy it "new", then it might be EOL / Discontinued. If you don't know when it was discontinued, set availability to "Discontinued", otherwise e.g. "Discontinued 2017".
