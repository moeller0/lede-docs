  * [[toh:start|I have a router and want to know if it is supported]] by LEDE
  * [[toh:views:toh_available_864|I want to buy a router which is supported]] by LEDE
  * [[toh:views:toh_fwdownload|Where can I download LEDE firmware for my router?]]

  * **Selected views:** Provide answers to your first questions.
    * Add your views //manually// to this list.
    * Preferably link the views with a kind of question, that the user wants to be answered.
  * **Complete lists:** 
    * Save your view in the ''views'' namespace. New views will //automatically// show up in these lists.
    * **Developer views** are accessible for all, but not interesting for all :)
    * **Admin views** are accessible for all, but mostly interesting for administrative purposes only (searching for missing data, ...).\\ However, take a look, maybe you can contribute some missing data?
