====== Frequently Asked Questions ======

===== What devices does LEDE target? =====

LEDE mainly targets embedded devices capable of running Linux. In most cases wireless routers. This has not changed compared to OpenWrt.

===== Is LEDE compatible with OpenWRT? =====

The packages distributed along with LEDE are the same you find in OpenWrt, and any instructions you find should work for both.

Sysupgrades from OpenWrt to LEDE or vice versa are supported but it is advised **not** to keep settings to benefit from the updated defaults.

===== Is LEDE good for me? =====

LEDE is primarily intended for networking enthusiasts, wireless communities, embedded device developers and power users.

While LEDE is a set of building blocks to implement your own projects, a default installation (with luci webinterface) is already much better than stock firmware of most devices, and adding more functionality is only a few clicks away.

===== How do I upgrade from OpenWrt to LEDE? =====

Migrating from OpenWrt to LEDE should work similar to upgrading from one OpenWrt release to another. Using the ''[[docs:user-guide:sysupgrade.cli|sysupgrade]]'' command is the preferred approach as this will also attempt to preserve the system configuration.


===== Where is the Forum? =====

===== What happens to the OpenWrt package feed? =====

LEDE plans to use the normal OpenWrt package feed, till it deviates too much from OpenWrt and it would be easier to have an own branch or feed.

===== Will OpenWrt Chaos Calmer still be supported? =====

OpenWrt Chaos Calmer will be supported with security and bug fixes by the OpenWrt project.

===== Were there any technical reasons to split from OpenWrt? =====

Nothing special, expect that LEDE wants to focus more on stability and not so much on bleeding edge any more. The release process should be better automatized and the release should be better tested.

===== Is LEDE represented by any Company or Industry organization? =====

No, LEDE is not affiliated with any specific company or any industry organization.

===== The company I work for uses LEDE and wants to support the project. What should we do? =====

Companies can best support LEDE by upstreaming the required code to support their products, any platform support code, patch submissions or even just detailed specifications are most appreciated.

Upstreaming product support also benefits the company in the long run as ongoing maintenance and porting effort decreases over time while the amount of internally required changes can be reduced.

===== Are there plans to license LEDE under a different License? =====

There are no plans to change the license of the LEDE code. It should be easy to copy code from and to OpenWrt.

===== What license does LEDE use? =====

The build system and many LEDE components are licensed under the GNU General Public License Version 2. Some parts are licensed under different licenses, this is mostly the case for packages not created in LEDE or OpenWrt.

===== Who holds the copyright of LEDE code? =====

The original authors of the code hold the copyright.

===== Is the LEDE project a registered legal entity? =====

No, the LEDE project is not a registered legal entity. The OpenWrt project is also not a registered legal entity, but OpenWrt is represented by Software in the Public Interest (SPI).

===== Is LEDE a registered trademark? =====

No, LEDE is not a registered trademark, but OpenWrt is a registered trademark which is held by the Software in the Public Interest (SPI) in the name of the OpenWrt project.
