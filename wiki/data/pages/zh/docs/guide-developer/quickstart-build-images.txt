====== 敏捷编译指引 ======

This is a very short guide on how to compile your first firmware.
It does not cover any pitfalls, but provides a quick way if everything goes well.

First we need to make sure the dependencies are installed (for Debian/Ubuntu):

<code>
sudo apt-get install subversion g++ zlib1g-dev build-essential git python rsync man-db
sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev gawk gettext unzip file libssl-dev wget
</code>

拉取 LEDE 源代码命令:

<code>
git clone https://git.lede-project.org/source.git lede
cd lede

./scripts/feeds update -a
./scripts/feeds install -a

make defconfig
make menuconfig
</code>

The last command will open a menu.

If you want to build images for the "TL-WR841N v11" Wifi-Router, select:

  * "Target System" => "Atheros AR7xxx/AR9xxx"
  * "Target Profile" => "TP-LINK TL-WR841N/ND v11"

Select exit and save your settings.
Now build images. That may take some time:

<code>
make
</code>

Afterwards, the images can be found in ./bin/targets/ar71xx/generic/ - done. 8-)

The *-factory.bin images are for the first installation.
The *-sysupgrade.bin images are for the updating existing LEDE installations.

注意:

  * For recompiling the images, just execute make again.
  * This will now be much faster as well.
  * Change settings with //make menuconfig// and compile again.
  * Files placed into a directory called files, will be placed into the root file system of the images. E.g. files/etc/config/my_config.
