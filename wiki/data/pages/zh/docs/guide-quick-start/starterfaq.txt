====== LEDE Starter FAQ ======

**嗯……我设备上已经成功刷上了 LEDE, 下面该做些什么？**\\
设置 root 的密码，设置无线 Wifi，熟悉一下用户手册里面的关于 问题与恢复 的内容，然后您也可以看看手册中您感兴趣的部分。

**我是默认安装，怎么才能进入图形界面管理后台？**\\
打开你的浏览器，访问 http://192.168.1.1 或 http://lede 。

**LEDE 默认的管理员帐号是什么？**\\
root

**root 的初始密码是什么？**\\
默认安装后， root 用户是没有密码的，您需要手工设置一下。你可以通过在终端界面使用命令 passwd ，或者通过 [[http://lede/cgi-bin/luci/admin/system/admin| LUCI 图形管理后台]] 设置。

**Can I reset the 'root' password, in case I have forgotten it?**\\
Yes, check the troubleshooting section of the user guide.

**I seem to have messed up the LEDE device configuration, my LEDE device is no longer accessible. What do I do?**\\
Check the troubleshooting section of the user guide, several recovery options are available.

**How can I enable SSL for the web admin gui?**\\
In an SSH-command line, run ''opkg update'', then install the package ''opkg install luci-ssl'', then restart the router. Then you can access https://192.168.1.1 or https://lede with your favorite web browser

**Is there a command line editor available in SSH?**\\
use ''vi''. It's most important key shortcuts are:\\
|ESC :q! | exits without saving|
|ESC :wq | exit and save|
|ESC i | insert text at the current cursor position|
|ESC x | delete the character under the cursor|
|ESC dd | delete the whole current line|
|ESC o | open new line below cursor|
|ESC O | open new line above cursor|

**What other tools can I use for administation of LEDE from a windows client?**\\
Get [[http://www.putty.org|Putty]] for SSH access to LEDE and get [[https://winscp.net|WinSCP]] as a file browser. For WinSCP to connect successful, you have to first ''opkg update'' then install the package ''opkg install openssh-sftp-server''. You can then use WinSCP to click through the LEDE file system and use its GUI editor for editing LEDE config files.

**I would like to customize LEDE, but am having difficulties finding the packages that I am interested in.**\\
Remember to first run ''opkg update'' once after each LEDE reboot, to refresh the list of available packages. LEDE will only temporary store the retrieved list in a temp RAM filesystem, loosing the list of updates on every reboot.

**Why is there a "WAN" and a "WAN6" and a "LAN" interface in LEDE, but no "LAN6" ?**\\
Note that there is a "WAN" and "WAN6" interface. Each of the 2 WAN interfaces holds config date related to the related upstream interface (WAN is for IPv4 and has "DHCP client", while WAN6 is for IPv6 has "DPCPv6 client"). On the other hand "LAN" has both the config data for the downstream side for both IPv4 and IPv6 associated, so there is no need to have an extra LAN6 interface.
Also note that both an interface and a zone called "LAN" exist. Also "WAN" is used both as a name for a zone and as a name for the IPv4 WAN interface. Both the "WAN" and "WAN6" interface belog to the "WAN" zone (so furthermore there is no "WAN6" zone)

**Why is there both a "Save & Apply" and a "Save" button in LuCi?**\\
You can do several different changes in different tabs, each time clicking "Save" without commiting the changes. You can then use "Save & Apply" to commit all of those changes in one transaction.

**What is the difference of total available memory, free and buffered shown in LuCi status overview?**\\
Total = free + buffered. \\
Buffered = memory that is temporarily in use to handle I/O operations\\
Free = really free memory\\
