====== Reasons to Use LEDE ======

People install LEDE because they find it to be superior to the stock firmware of their router or embedded device. This page showcases many aspects of LEDE.

===== Performance & Stability =====
LEDE is designed by network professionals and others who care about the performance of their network. LEDE incorporates many algorithms from recent research that perform far better than vendor-supplied firmware.
    * LEDE is stable, and operates reliably for long periods of time.
    * LEDE reduces latency/lag and increased network throughput via bufferbloat control algorithms.
    * Wi-Fi improvements support higher data rates and airtime fairness between stations.
    * Older devices are still supported by LEDE improvements (as long as RAM/Flash of your device can accommodate new releases) long after the manufacturer stops making updates.

===== Security =====
LEDE is an open source software. Many developers from all over the world review the code before it's released. 
    * No hidden backdoors left by hardware vendors. 
    * LEDE is resistant to common vulnerabilities thanks to its Linux OS which is unaffected by many common attacks.
    * LEDE is actively updated so any vulnerabilities are closed shortly after they are discovered.
    * Default LEDE configuration is very conservative allowing full internet connectivity without exposing your router or connected devices to attacks.
    * Many of the older devices are supported by LEDE and can enjoy security LEDE brings, long after vendors stop releasing firmware updates.
    * LEDE prolongs the life of your router. While many vendors only provide updates for your router/device until the newer model is released, LEDE supports all [[:supported_devices|compatible models]] for as long as their RAM/Flash can accommodate new releases.

===== Extensibility =====
 
While vendor firmware for a router ships with a fixed set of capabilities, LEDE provides more than [[packages:start|3000 packages]] ready to be installed. Some of the more popular packages allow you to:
    * Run [[docs:user-guide:ad-blocking]] on your router so you can enjoy clean uncluttered web experience from any connected device.
    * Reduce latency/lag (bufferbloat) even during heavy traffic with [[docs:user-guide:sqm|Smart Queue Management]]
    * Secure access to your home network when away via [[docs:user-guide:openvpn.server|OpenVPN Server]].
    * Secure your internet access and prevent your ISP from snooping on your internet activity (requires third party service) [[docs:user-guide:openvpn.client|OpenVPN Client]]. 
    * Prevent your ISP from snooping on your DNS requests via [[docs:user-guide:dnscrypt-proxy|DNSCrypt Proxy]].
    * Force connected devices with hard-coded DNS servers to use your router's DNS with [[docs:user-guide:DNS-request-hijacking|DNS Request Hijacking]].
    * Create a [[docs:user-guide:guestwifi_configuration|Guest Network for Guest WiFi]] allowing access to internet, but not your local devices.
    * Control access using the [[docs:user-guide:parental-controls|time limits and parental controls]].
    * [[docs:user-guide:webcam|Add a webcam]] for live surveillance or timelapse video creation of landscapes or 3D printers.
    * [[docs:user-guide:weatherstation|Connect to your weather station]], record [[docs:user-guide:weather.statistics|weather statistics]] and make them accessible via a [[docs:user-guide:webserver|webserver]], garnished with a [[docs:user-guide:webcam|live webcam image]].
    * [[docs:user-guide:1wire|Interact with 1-wire devices]] (sensors, actors, ...).
    * Make your router a central for [[docs:user-guide:home automation|home automation]].
    * Access a wider range of [[docs:user-guide:ddns.client|Dynamic DNS (ddns)]] providers than vendor firmware via [[packages:pkgdata:ddns-scripts|DDNS scripts]].


===== Community  Support =====

The vibrant community of developers, volunteers, and other long-time LEDE users are always available to help solve an issue. 

  * [[https://forum.lede-project.org|LEDE forum]] - member-to-member conversations about LEDE
  * [[http://lists.infradead.org/mailman/listinfo/lede-dev|LEDE Developer]] and [[http://lists.infradead.org/mailman/listinfo/lede-adm|LEDE Admin]] mailing lists
  * [[https://webchat.freenode.net/|#lede-dev]] and [[https://webchat.freenode.net/|#lede-adm]] on IRC
  * [[:contact|Contacts]] on the LEDE site for more information.

===== Research Platform =====

Many teams who are doing cutting-edge research into networking topics use LEDE as a stable platform for their work. As their work moves from the experimental realm into practical, production-quality code, it is available in LEDE builds first. Some teams using LEDE include:
  * Continuing development of the [[http://bufferbloat.net|fq_codel and cake algorithms]] that decrease bufferbloat.
  * The [[https://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/make-wifi-fast/wiki/|Make Wi-Fi Fast]] team has been working to decrease queueing and latency in the wi-fi stack, and is testing out their airtime fairness code using LEDE.
  * [[http://homewrt.org|Homenet]] provides implementation of zeroconf IPv6 (and IPv4) routing, prefix assignment and service discovery for a home network consisting of multiple routers connected to multiple service providers. There's a hnet-full package for LEDE.

===== Configuration===== 
Because LEDE is a true Linux-based system, you have full control over all functions of your router/device.
  * LEDE provides both command-line interface (via SSH) and a web-based user interface for configuration. 
  * Configuration information is stored in plain-text files to ease the editing and/or copying.
  * LEDE Image Builder allows you to create your own firmware images for your device with any customizations (pre-defined password, WiFi, etc).
  * The Web GUI allows you to select [[docs:user-guide:luci.themes|themes]] that suit your needs/tastes In addition, [[packages:pkgdata:luci-i18n-base-lang|Localization of Web UI]] is available via packages in over 20 languages.
  * Configure the external LEDs and buttons/switches to suit your needs.

===== Zero Cost =====
LEDE is provided for free through its GPL license, and thanks to the efforts of many volunteer contributors (both individuals and companies). There are no subscription or licensing fees.
