====== Communication within the LEDE Project ======

One of LEDE's goals is that all project-related communication should be done on public channels that are archived and easily browsable. However, specific problems and tasks may be resolved using direct means of communication. Please look through these choices to find an appropriate means to reach us.

===== Forum =====

The [[https://forum.lede-project.org|LEDE Forum]] provides a place for direct member-to-member conversations about Installing and running LEDE; Requesting help with development questions; Discussing the documentation; and Publicizing community builds, new packages, and projects that use LEDE. Forum members can follow the discussion via the web, or optionally through email. 

===== Mailing Lists =====

The project offers the following mailing lists:

  - [[https://lists.infradead.org/mailman/listinfo/lede-dev|lede-dev@lists.infradead.org]] - Use this list for submitting patches and general development related work.
  - [[https://lists.infradead.org/mailman/listinfo/lede-adm|lede-adm@lists.infradead.org]] - Use this list for project organisational purposes. Anyone can subscribe and read this list, only committers may write to this list.

In addition there are two read-only announcement lists:

  - [[http://lists.infradead.org/mailman/listinfo/lede-bugs|lede-bugs@lists.infradead.org]] - This list receives bug tracking notifications from Flyspray.
  - [[http://lists.infradead.org/mailman/listinfo/lede-commits|lede-commits@lists.infradead.org]] - This list tracks the commits to our ''%%source.git%%'' and ''%%web.git%%'' repositories.

===== IRC Channels =====

The project provides 2 IRC channels on [[https://webchat.freenode.net/|freenode]]:

  - #lede-dev - a public channel for everyone to join and participate.
  - #lede-adm - a moderated channel that anyone can join but only people with +v flag can write on.

===== Server Status Changes Announcements on Twitter =====

===== Corporate Contact =====

Please direct general inquiries to <lede-contact@lede-project.org> to open a confidential discussion with the [[:about#people|project developers]].

This contact address is primarily intended to find a suitable mode of cooperation and to inquire about project matters without having to disclose your corporate identity upfront. There will be no special treatment beyond this first contact. Please see the [[:rules|LEDE Project Rules]] for further information.

Actual development should happen in public and corporations are strongly encouraged to send their contributions through the public mailing lists or in the form of Github pull requests.
