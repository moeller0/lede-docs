====== Downloads ======

===== Browse the LEDE Firmware Repository =====
These links takes you to the download directory of the current hardware, grouped by processor type of the devices.\\
LEDE software has two distinct branches: a stable **Release** build that is suitable for production use, and a **Development** build that contains an ever-evolving set of enhancements.

^  [[https://downloads.lede-project.org/releases/|Stable Release builds]]  ^  [[https://downloads.lede-project.org/snapshots/targets/|Development Snapshot builds]]  ^
| The **Release** builds have had significant testing. Use them for production, or for your home where your family will rely on a functioning router. [[:releases:start|More...]] | Get the latest with a **Development** build. These contain the latest technology, but may not work well, or at all. Be prepared to supply bug reports, etc. [[:releases:snapshot|More...]] |

==== How to mirror ====

Please use ''%%rsync://downloads.lede-project.org/downloads%%'' to obtain a copy of the download repository.

Syncing the downloads share every 12 to 24 hours hours is ideal. Once a mirror has been set up, feel free to announce it at ''%%lede-adm@lists.lede-project.org%%'' so that it can be published on this page.

The data volume of the snapshots is roughly 35GB, we expect it to grow by 30-40GB with each release. Due to current bandwidth constraints we kindly ask you to use something like ''%%rsync --bwlimit 8000%%'' when initially pulling the data.

==== Sources ====

<del>Any source code archives fetched by the buildbots during the build process are available at http://sources.lede-project.org/
