===== Explanations =====

==== factory.img/.bin ====

====  initramfs-uImage.bin ====
 
====  initramfs-kernel.bin ====

==== sdcard.img.gz ====

==== sysupgrade / factory ====

There are basically two potential reasons why only a sysupgrade image is available for your router, either the router is already running some kind of OpenWrt fork (which understands the sysupgrade format natively) or there simply is no known way to assemble a factory image accepted by the router.\\
