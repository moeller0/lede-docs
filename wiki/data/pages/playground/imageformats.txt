====== Image formats ======


===== Standard formats =====

==== sysupgrade or trx images ====
Previously know as //trx image//, //sysupgrade// is designed to be flashed from OpenWrt/LEDE itself ((https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/faq/before.installation)).

==== factory ====
Designed to be flashed by the bootloader flasher or stock firmware flasher ((https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/faq/before.installation))


===== Specific formats =====

==== initramfs ====
Usually first part of a multi-stage installation, this type of firmware can be loaded from an arbitrary location and is self-contained in memory.  This is like a Linux LiveCD. ((https://forum.lede-project.org/t/toward-a-good-flashing-lede-instructions-page/52/5))

==== u-boot or uImage ====
<color #ed1c24>This is an image format designed for U-Boot loader.  Same as initramfs?</color> ((https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/faq/before.installation)) ((https://docs.blackfin.uclinux.org/doku.php?id=bootloaders:u-boot:uimage))

==== ext4 ====
This firmware contains a regular ext4 Linux partition.  Mostly used in x86 and x86_x64 systems.

==== squashfs ====
This firmware contains a type of partition that is compressed and mounts read-only.  All modifications (file edit, new files, deleted files) are committed to an overlay.

==== rootfs ====
Only the root filesystem of LEDE

==== kernel ====
<color #ed1c24>??</color>

==== ubifs ====
<color #ed1c24>??</color>

==== ubi ====
<color #ed1c24>??</color>

==== tftp ====
<color #ed1c24>Designed to be loaded from tftp server.  Device in recovery mode?</color>


===== Subformats =====

==== bin, img, elf, dtb, chk, dlf ====
These are raw binary data of the firmware file

==== xz, gz, tar, lzma ====
These are compressed images


===== Developer files =====

==== sdk ====
SDK Toolchain for compiling single userspace packages ((https://we.riseup.net/lackof/openwrt-on-x86-64))

==== Imagebuilder ====
To build custom images without compiling ((https://we.riseup.net/lackof/openwrt-on-x86-64))

==== vmlinux ====
Linux kernel for build ((https://we.riseup.net/lackof/openwrt-on-x86-64))
