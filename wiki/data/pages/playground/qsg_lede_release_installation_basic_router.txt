=== QSG - LEDE Release Installation - Basic Router ===


=== Folded Plugin Example ===  
++++ To Configure a Router click Here  |

It does not appear one can add any formatting to the above line of text, including Headers and Bold.

Formatting "Folded" begins with a group of 4 (+) signs, a title and then a pipe.  Content is below and up until a closing set of 4 (+) chrs.

  * Bullet lists are working
  * **Formatting** //is working// __also__ ''(at least <del>in this</del> example)''
  * Doesn't work with %%<code>%% tags or %%<WRAP>%% :(
  * Doesn't work with section headings

  - Ordered List Item
  - And another one

===== Do section headings work? =====

No, they don't.
