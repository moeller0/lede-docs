====== LEDE Documentation ======
~~NOTOC~~

LEDE is a highly extensible GNU/Linux distribution for embedded devices (typically wireless routers). LEDE is based on the OpenWrt project. Unlike many other distributions for routers, LEDE is built from the ground up to be a full-featured, easily modifiable operating system for embedded devices. In practice, this means that you can have all the features you need with none of the bloat, powered by a modern Linux kernel.
