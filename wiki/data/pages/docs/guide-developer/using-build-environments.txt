====== Using Build Environments ======

LEDE provides a means of building images for multiple configurations which can use multiple targets in one single checkout. These environments store a copy of the ''.config'' file generated by ''make menuconfig'' and the contents of the ''./files'' folder. The script ''./scripts/env'' is used to manage these environments, it uses ''git'' (which needs to be installed on your system) as backend for version control.

Setting up git
<code>git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "user@email.com"</code>

Git requires some name and email address to work so we set them here.

The command
<code>./scripts/env help</code>

produces a short help text with a list of commands.

To create a new environment named current, run the following command
<code>./scripts/env new current</code>

This will move your ''.config'' file and ''./files'' (if it exists) to the ''env/'' subdirectory and create symlinks in the base folder.

After running ''make menuconfig'' or changing things in ''files/'', your current state will differ from what has been saved before. To show these changes, use:
<code>./scripts/env diff</code>

If you want to save these changes, run:
<code>./scripts/env save</code>

If you want to revert your changes to the previously saved copy, run:
<code>./scripts/env revert</code>

If you want, you can now create a second environment using the new command. It will ask you whether you want to make it a clone of the current environment (e.g. for minor changes) or if you want to start with a clean version (e.g. for selecting a new target).

To switch to a different environment (e.g. test1), use:
<code>./scripts/env switch test1</code>

To rename the current branch to a new name (e.g. test2), use:
<code>./scripts/env rename test2</code>

If you want to get rid of environment switching and keep everything in the base directory again, use:
<code>./scripts/env clear </code>
