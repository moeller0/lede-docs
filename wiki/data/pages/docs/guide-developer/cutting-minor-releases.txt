  * [[https://gist.github.com/jow-/ee725f70577185052cf45d735deee138|make-changelog.pl]]

===== Preparing the Sources =====

  - Ensure your source checkout is up to date
  - Create the signed tags''./maketag.sh -k <gpg key id> -v <new_version>''
  - Review the changes ''git log -p -2'' ''git show <new_version>''
  - Push the changes to the git repository ''git push origin lede-17.01; git push --follow-tags origin refs/tags/v17.01.3:refs/tags/v17.01.3''


===== Building the Release =====

To trigger a full release build, you need to

  - Log in to the [[http://release-builds.lede-project.org/17.01/images/|release buildbot]]
  - Go to "Builders"
  - Populate the reason field (e.g. "trigger release build")
  - Populate the first "name" field with "tag", and the "value" field with the release tag name without the v. It should show something along ''reason "Trigger release build", name[0] = tag, value[0] = 17.01.3''.
  - Click "Force All Builds"

This will take about 12 hours.

In the mean time, prepare the changelog. Run
''./make-changelog.pl <previous_release>..<new_release> > template.txt '' to generate the changelog. Verify that the changelog was generated correctl,y remove the "(WIP)" from the title and put them it [[https://lede-project.org/releases/17.01/changelog-17.01.3]].
