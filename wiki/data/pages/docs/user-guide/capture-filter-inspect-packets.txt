====== How to capture, filter and inspect packets ======

LEDE is a versatile platform base on GNU/Linux, offering state-of-the art solutions. You may use [[http://www.tcpdump.org|tcpdump]] ,  [[https://www.wireshark.org|Wireshark]] or even collect data from a switch and send it to a remote analysis system. This article does not cover network intrusion detection, which is documented separately.

This HOWTO is based on a discussion on LEDE Forum, please discuss using this link:

Feel free to modify this HOWTO and enjoy LEDE!

===== Capturing packets from a LEDE appliance =====

tcpdump is a network capture and analysis tool. It may be used to capture packets on the fly and/or save them in a file for later analysis. tcpdump relies on libcap, therefore it can produce standard pcap analysis files which may be processed by other tools.

To install [[http://www.tcpdump.org|tcpdump]] on your LEDE device:

  opkg install tcpdump
  
To capture all packets on the WAN (eth1):

  tcpdump -n -i eth1
  tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
  listening on eth1, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144 bytes
  13:16:55.036711 IP 192.168.1.94.41146 > 121.59.12.182.443: Flags [.], ack 2010466204, win 444, options [nop,nop,TS val 1064304519 ecr 2837800946], length 0

  13:16:56.072201 IP 139.59.209.225.443 > 192.168.1.94.38886: Flags [.], seq 1:1449, ack 652, win 368, options [nop,nop,TS val 651567951 ecr 689756067], length 1448 

You may also use Wireshark capture and analysis tool. 

To capture all packets on the WAN:
  - Enable SSH connection with certificated (to avoid password prompt)
  - Under your GNU/Linux station or MacOsX:

  ssh user@myledebox tcpdump -i eth1 -U -s0 -w - 'not port 22' | sudo wireshark -k -i -


===== Capturing packets from a switch =====

Modern switches offer port-mirroring, i.e. the ability to copy all network packets from a given number of ports to a single-port, usually for analysis purpose. Usually, switches with port-mirroring are called "manageable switches". Port mirroring happens in hardware, so your switch might not slow down. Check your documentation if port mirroring is supported.

Connect your LEDE device to the monitoring interface of your switch. 

Then simply use tcpdump or wireshark to monitor traffic.

===== Sending packets for remote analysis on the WWW =====

[[https://www.cloudshark.org|CloudShark]] is an cloud analysis platform, independent and not related to LEDE. It relies on cshark plugin to send packets remotely for analysis. Please check your internal rules, whether sending network traffic to a cloud platform is allowed. 

Install cshark and luci-app-cshark:

  opkg install cshark luci-app-cshark

Please check [[https://support.cloudshark.org/openwrt/openwrt-cloudshark.html|Cloud shark documentation]] for more information.


===== Questions remaining to be documented =====
Please insert here what remains to be documented:

- How to send (automatically) pcap files remotely for later analysis, on your own network.

- How to trap network traffic using simple rules and log them to syslog/rsyslog.

- Are there uci / luci apps allowing to manage tcpdum rules, traffic analysis, etc ...
