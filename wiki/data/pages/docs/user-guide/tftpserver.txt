====== Set up a TFTP Server ======

LEDE firmware has a built-in "TFTP recovery mode" or "de-bricking mode" that may regain control of your device in the event of a bad flash or misconfiguration. You power up the router, and press a button to force the device to request a new image via TFTP. The Device Page for your model gives more details. The outline of the process is:

  - Download the desired LEDE (or stock) firmware image to the designated TFTP directory on your computer
  - Set the IP address of your computer's Ethernet interface as described in the Device Page for your model.
  - Start the TFTP server on your computer.
  - Power up the router and press the specified button.

This page gives instructions for setting up a TFTP server on your computer that can supply the image for recovery. 

===== TFTP Server on Mac OSX =====

OSX provides a native tftpd server that runs the command line. However, TFTPServer.app from http://ww2.unime.it/flr/tftpserver/ provides a pleasant GUI wrapper around the native command that makes the process less error prone. This procedure was tested with TftpServer.app v 3.4.1 on OSX 10.10.5 in December 2016. 

  - Download and install TftpServer.app from the URL above.
  - Move the application to a convenient directory.
  - In the same directory, create another folder named 'tftpfiles'. This is the 'designated TFTP directory'. //TftpServer.app and tftpfiles will be in the same directory.//
  - Set the OSX IP address as specified in the Device Page's TFTP Recovery section.
  - Launch TftpServer.app. The window is shown here. //You should confirm that you see the desired file named in the window.// \\ :{{:media:tftpserver-osx.png?200|}} 
  - Click "Start TFTP" (upper left). //You should see the "Server Status:" change to "Running".//
  - Start your router and press the button. //The file will transfer.//
  - //Note:// TftpServer.app may give warnings about file permissions. Use the "Fix" buttons at the bottom of the window to set the permissions properly.
  - Click "Stop TFTP" or quit the application to stop the TFTP server. 

===== TFTP Server on Windows =====

While there is a command line TFTP server/client feature in windows, it's easier to use a third party one that has a proper graphical interface.

A simple and free TFTP application is **Tftpd32**, available [[http://tftpd32.jounin.net/tftpd32.html|here]] (Tftpd64 is the 64-bit version and will be used in this example).

Download the portable version, and unzip it in a folder. You should see the manual, a license in a PDF file, a configuration file, and the application executable itself.

Place the file you want to send (the firmware file usually) in the same folder where you find the **Tftpd64** program file. The folder exposed through TFTP can be changed by clicking on Browse button, but in most situations you don't need to do that.

Configure your ethernet port according to your device's own recovery method as detailed in [[docs:user-guide:vendor_specific_rescue|Rescue from failed firmware upgrade]], note that in most cases you can't use that port to connect to the internet until you reconfigure it back like it was before.

Double-click on the **Tftpd64** program file and you should get a Windows Firewall popup asking you to grant access. Check both options, to allow **Tftpd64** to communicate over both home/work and public networks. This is very important, if the Windows Firewall blocks your TFTP server you won't be able to access it from the device you want to recover.

Click on the drop-down menu called **Server Interfaces** and select your PC's ethernet port.

Now the tftp server is online and ready, and the file(s) in it can be accessed as normal.
