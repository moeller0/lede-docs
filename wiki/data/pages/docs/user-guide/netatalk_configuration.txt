====== AFP Netatalk share configuration (aka Apple Time Machine). ======
Netatalk is an OpenSource software package, that can be used to turn a *NIX machine into an extremely high-performance and reliable file server for Macintosh computers. Using Netatalk's AFP 3.3 compliant file-server leads to significantly higher transmission speeds compared with Macs accessing a server via SaMBa/NFS while providing clients with the best possible user experience (full support for Macintosh metadata, flawlessly supporting mixed environments of classic Mac OS and OS X clients)

This guide will walk you though the steps of installing the required packages and settings up linux users on the LEDE device so your Mac(s) can securely connect over the network to your Time Machine server.

In order for this guide to work you will need to meet the following prerequisites:
  * [[docs:user-guide:drives|Setup storage device with Ext4 filesystem]]
  * [[docs:user-guide:fstab_configuration|Configuration Fstab for automatic storage mount]]

==== Package Installation ====
  opkg update && opkg install avahi-utils netatalk

==== Optional Package Installation ====
These packages are optional although recommend. nano will make editing text files super easy and the shadow packages make user and group managment a breeze, otherwise you'll have to manually edit user, group and password files by hand. The downside these packages will use precious space on your root partition. If your working with limited space consider using [[docs:user-guide:extroot_configuration|extroot]].

  opkg update && opkg install nano shadow-groupadd shadow-groupmod shadow-useradd shadow-usermod
==== Available Netatalk Features ====
Many of the Netatalk goodies such as Spotlight search, Zeroconfig, ACL and LDAP support have been disabled. That was probably a wise decision to save space and provide a broader range of hardware support. The good news Time Machine support is available. With a simple command ''afpd -V'' we can check what features have been compiled into Netatalk.

==== Basic File Share Configuration (Time Machine Server) ====
 <WRAP center round todo 90%>
The current Netatalk package ''(netatalk - 3.1.10-1)'' has minor posix permission issues.
</WRAP>
Use the following ''chmod'' commands to fix this bug.
  chmod 644 /etc/afp.conf
  chmod 644 /etc/extmap.conf


The afp.conf file contains all AFP specific configurations and AFP volume definitions. Let's edit ours with ''nano /etc/afp.conf'' and setup our Time Machine Server; we'll be using the nano text editor in this tutorial. Netatalk has a lot of great features not covered in this //guide//. Make sure to checkout the documentation for more Time Machine options and other possible AFP uses. [[http://netatalk.sourceforge.net/3.0/htmldocs/afp.conf.5.html]]

<code>
;
; Netatalk 3.x configuration file

[Backups]
     path = /mnt/sdb1/Backups
     time machine = yes
     vol size limit = 250000
     valid users = @users
</code>
==== Avahi-daemon Configuration ====
The default avahi-daemon configuration ''/etc/avahi/avahi-daemon.conf'' works perfect with stable LEDE 17.01.0+ and no chages are required.

<code>
[server]
#host-name=LEDE
#domain-name=local
use-ipv4=yes
use-ipv6=yes
check-response-ttl=no
use-iff-running=no

[publish]
publish-addresses=yes
publish-hinfo=yes
publish-workstation=no
publish-domain=yes
#publish-dns-servers=192.168.1.1
#publish-resolv-conf-dns-servers=yes

[reflector]
enable-reflector=no
reflect-ipv=no

[rlimits]
#rlimit-as=
rlimit-core=0
rlimit-data=4194304
rlimit-fsize=0
rlimit-nofile=30
rlimit-stack=4194304
rlimit-nproc=3
</code>

==== Zeroconf Advertising ====
The LEDE implementation of Netatalk was not compiled with Zeroconf support; so we must advertise the required afpovertcp, device-info, and adisk text-record properties manually. We previously installed avahi-daemon (via avahi-utils) for exactly this purpose. Let's create a service file ''nano /etc/avahi/services/afp.service'' using the template below.

<code xml>
<?xml version="1.0" standalone='no'?><!--*-nxml-*-->
<!DOCTYPE service-group SYSTEM "avahi-service.dtd">
<service-group>
 <name replace-wildcards="yes">%h</name>
  <service>
   <type>_afpovertcp._tcp</type>
   <port>548</port>
  </service>
  <service>
   <type>_device-info._tcp</type>
   <port>0</port>
   <txt-record>model=TimeCapsule</txt-record>
  </service>
  <service>
   <type>_adisk._tcp</type>
   <port>9</port>
   <txt-record>sys=waMa=0,adVF=0x100,adVU=00000000-AAAA-BBBB-CCCC-111111111111</txt-record>
   <txt-record>dk0=adVN=Backups,adVF=0x81</txt-record>
  </service>
</service-group>
</code>

:!: ''model=TimeCapsule'' this determines the hardware icon that appear within macOS Finder. Some available options are Xserve, PowerBook, PowerMac, Macmini, iMac, MacBook, MacBookPro, MacBookAir, MacPro, MacPro6,1, TimeCapsule, AppleTV1,1 and AirPort.

:!: ''adVU=00000000-AAAA-BBBB-CCCC-111111111111'' must be changed to a uniquely generated UUID. You can create a UUID in LEDE by writing ''cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid'' (each time generating and displaying a new UUID).

:!: ''adVN=Backups'' should match the virtual volume name of your ''timemachine = YES'' share from ''/etc/afp.conf''. If you used my example settings above; leave this set to ''Backups''. Most online guides use //"TimeMachine"// however //"Backups"// is more traditional since it's the default when using macOS Server or Time Capsule; although it realy dosen't matter what you call it, as long as they both match.

==== User and Group Management ====
In this section we'll create two (2) new users on the LEDE system for file sharing purposes. Create as many or as little as you like, the principles are the same. We'll also accomplish the following:
  * create home folders for the new user(s)
  * create a group with the same name as the new user(s)
  * add new user(s) to a supplementary group named "users"

1. Create a place for the users home folder with ''mkdir /home/''. The default location for most Linux distros.

2. Add the new user(s). In my example users anne & brian will be created. They will receive a home folder ''/home/username'' and become members of the group ''users'' and ''username''.
  useradd --create-home --groups users --user-group anne
  useradd --create-home --groups users --user-group brian

3. Add passwords for the newly created user(s).
  passwd anne
  passwd brian

4. Change the permissions of the Backups directory. You will have to improvise and use your systems own mount and or backup location.
  cd /mnt/sdb1/
  mkdir Backups
  chmod 775 Backups/
  chgrp users Backups/

5. Verify the permission changes with ''ls -alF''.
  root@LEDE:/mnt/sdb1# ls -alF
  drwxr-xr-x    5 root     root          4096 Apr 25 18:48 ./
  drwxr-xr-x    1 root     root           224 Apr 25 21:49 ../
  drwxrwxr-x    2 root     users         4096 Apr 25 21:01 Backups/
  drwxr-xr-x    3 root     root          4096 Apr 25 18:48 Shared/
  drwx------    2 root     root         16384 Apr 25 16:35 lost+found/

:!: The ''users'' group is very important because the ''valid users = @users'' option in the Netatalk configuration. All members in this group have access to Time Machine services. Lets check what members makeup the ''users'' group with ''grep users /etc/group''. You should see somthing similar to my results.
  root@LEDE:~# grep users /etc/group
  users:x:100:mrengles,anne,brian
==== Preserving Configuration on Firmware Upgrade ====

FIXME I'm not sure if this section is required.

The default LEDE firmware upgrade procedure might not backup some of our configuration files. That would be a horrible waste of hard work.

Add them to the list of custom backup files at ''/etc/sysupgrade.conf'' with ''echo'' and the command line:

<code>
echo '/etc/afp.conf ' >> /etc/sysupgrade.conf
echo '/etc/avahi/ ' >> /etc/sysupgrade.conf
echo '/etc/extmap.conf ' >> /etc/sysupgrade.conf
echo '/home/ ' >> /etc/sysupgrade.conf
echo '/var/netatalk/ ' >> /etc/sysupgrade.conf
</code>

This can also be accomplished via LuCi > System > Backup / Flash Firmware > Configurations > Backup file list and simply append the following:

<code>
/etc/afp.conf
/etc/avahi/
/etc/extmap.conf
/home/
/var/netatalk/
</code>

For more information, please check the [[docs:user-guide:sysupgrade.cli|Upgrading LEDE from the Command Line]]
==== Setup Time Machine on macOS ====
Settting up Time Machine on the Mac is a very simple process:
  * Open System Preferences > Time Machine > Select Backup Disk.
  * Select "Backups on LEDE" (encrypted backups will also work).
  * Login with your username and password (from earlier in this guide).

Apple can explain how-to use Time Machine much better then myself, so I'll let them. If you completed this //guide// successfully, chances are you wont need help. [[https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201250]]

:!: Depending on your storage requirements the initial backup could take several hours.

==== Final Thoughts ====
If you have questions, post them in the LEDE Project Forum so that myslef and others can respond. [[https://forum.lede-project.org]]

Please update this user guide if you have a better way of doing things or notice typos and errors. :-)
