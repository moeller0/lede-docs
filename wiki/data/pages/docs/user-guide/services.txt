===== Managing system services =====

LEDE system is composed of many different programs running all the time called daemons or services.\\
The default ones are already set up in a standard installation, but you may want to change their configuration or add new ones with packages.

==== CLI Syntax ====

''service'' will print a list of available services

''service service_name'' will print a list of available actions for a service

''service service_name action'' will execute that action on that service

Technically speaking, the ''service'' command is just a wrapper for initscripts found in **/etc/init.d**.\\
The above commands are functionally identical to the following ones (respectively), they are just shorter and easier to remember.\\
''ls /etc/init.d/''\\
''/etc/init.d/service_name''\\
''/etc/init.d/service_name action''\\

==== Luci web interface ====

Click on **System**, then on **Startup** to land in the page listing all the available services and buttons to execute actions.

==== Actions ====
The default actions supported by most services are:
^ Action  ^ Description ^
| **start**  | Start the service |
| **stop** | Stop the service |
| **restart** | Restart the service |
| **reload** | Reload configuration files (or restart if that fails) |
| **enable** | Enable service autostart |
| **disable** | Disable service autostart |
