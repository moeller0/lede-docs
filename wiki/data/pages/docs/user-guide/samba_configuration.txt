====== SMB Samba share overview (aka Windows file sharing). ======

To setup samba, follow this description

===== 1. Mounting storage =====
see: [[docs:user-guide:drives| Setting up storage devices ]]\\
When done setting up your mount point, verify (e.g. with ''ls /mnt'' in the command line) that at least one mount point exists, before continuing.

===== 2. Installing samba =====
To find out, if samba is already installed on your device, try to query the samba version:
<code>
smbd -V
</code>
if this fails, you have to install samba. To do so, first identify the samba version available for your installation:
<code>
opkg update
opkg list | grep samba
</code>
In our example the available version is "samba36":
<code>
luci-app-samba - git-17.219.28675-9ee26ac-1 - Network Shares - Samba SMB/CIFS module
...
samba36-client - 3.6.25-6 - Samba 3.6 SMB/CIFS client
samba36-server - 3.6.25-6 - The Samba software suite is a collection of programs that implements the SMB protocol for UNIX systems, allowing 
</code>

Mandatory: Now install the samba server package:
<code>
opkg install samba36-server
</code>

Optional: if you need a command line samba client for debugging problems, also install:
<code>
opkg install samba36-client
</code>

Optional: If you want a simple LuCi GUI config for samba, also install:
<code>
opkg install luci-app-samba
</code>
===== 3. Configuring the samba service: "config samba" section of /etc/config/samba =====
Usually you will not have to change defaults provided in this section. In some cases, you may want to adapt the "interface" parameter, in case the samba service should listen on different interfaces.\\

This config section determines values and options relevant to the overall operation of samba. The following table lists all available options, their default value and respectively a short characterization. See [[http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/man/manpages-3/smb.conf.5.html#idp58030944|smb.conf man page]] for further details.
These are the default settings for the common options:

<code>
config 'samba'
	option 'name' 'lede'
	option 'workgroup' 'lede'
	option 'description' 'Samba on lede'
	option 'charset' 'UTF-8'
	option 'homes' '0'
	option 'interface' 'loopback lan'
</code>

^Name           ^Type   ^Required^Default                     ^Option^Description                       ^
|//name//       |string |no      |hostname or lede            |      |Name of the Server                |
|//workgroup//  |string |no      |hostname or lede            |      |Name of the Workgroup             |
|//description//|string |no      |Samba on hostname or lede   |      |Description of the Server         |
|//charset//    |string |no      |UTF-8                       |      |Display charset & unix charset    |
|//homes//      |boolean|no      |0                           |0, 1  |Share the user directory          |
|//interface//  |string |no      |loopback lan                |      |Interfaces samba should listen on.|


===== 4. Configuring a samba share: "config sambashare" section of /etc/config/samba =====
SAMBA will be reachable via NetBIOS by default.
In this section you need to configure the disk folders you intend to make accessible to users in your LAN.
Ensure that you have already have attached a USB harddisk to the USB-Port and //correctly// mounted a partition. You can choose to share the partition as a whole, or just individual directories on it. For each entry you need to create an individual config //sambashare// section.

In the following example, the SMB sharename **Sharename** is mapped to a connected drive that is mapped to **/mnt/sda3**.
<code>
config 'sambashare'
	option 'name' 'Sharename'
	option 'path' '/mnt/sda3'
	option 'create_mask' '0700'
	option 'dir_mask' '0700'
	option read_only 'no'
	...
</code>
  * Run ''ls /mnt'' in the command line, if you need to debug/identify your available mount points.
  * you may need to adapt "create mask" and "dir mask" in case vFAT/FAT32 or exFAT is used as file system on the external drive. It is recommended to try EXT4 first in case of problems.
  * Set read_only to yes, if you want to disable write access

^Name           ^Type     ^Required^Default                              ^Option ^Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ^

Each samba share can be configured at either share level access or user level access. 
  * At share level access all users on the network can access the share, and all files are shared with all users. 
  * At user level access a username and password are needed to access the share. 
By default Samba is configured for user level access (this is also the recommended way).

==== Samba share config when using "share level" access ====
To set share level access 
  * change //security = user// to //security = share// in ///etc/samba/smb.conf.template//
  * Decide for your self, if you want to set ''option 'read_only' 'yes''' to '''no''', to enable unrestricted anonymous access including write permission.
  * set //guest_ok// to //yes// on the share
<code>
config 'sambashare'
        ...
	option 'read_only' 'yes'
	option 'guest_ok' 'yes'
</code>

==== Samba share config when using "user level" access ====

Make sure that //guest ok// is set to //no// and allow your created user to access the fileshare with the option //users// by adding the usernames.\\
If you want to add more than one user, use a comma separated list.\\
In the following example we will allow **newuser** to access the share.
<code>
config 'sambashare'
        ...
	option guest_ok 'no'
	option users 'newuser'
</code>



===== 5. Adding samba user(s) =====
To access a samba share with user level access there must be users added to the system by editing ''/etc/passwd''.\\

Add a line for each required user. Choose a unique user id (the first number in the line) of 1000 or higher that does not exist yet. Set the group identification number (the second number) to '65534' (the same number as the user nobody). Copy the rest.\\
\\
e.g. to create a user:
  * user in this example will be called 'newuser'" (this is the loginname you need to enter, when Windows pops up the authentication dialogue)
  * with the unique system ID '1000'
  * with the group id '65534' (which is the group identifier for 'nobody'= no special default group)
  * '/var' just means the user will not need a special home folder on the system
  * '/bin/false' means the user will not have a default shell program associated
<code>
root:0:0:root:/root:/bin/ash
nobody:*:65534:65534:nobody:/var:/bin/false
daemon:*:65534:65534:daemon:/var:/bin/false
newuser:*:1000:65534:newuser:/var:/bin/false
</code>

  * keep in mind that the user(s) and group(s) utilized by Samba need to have the proper permissions for their shares, i.e. they need write access in order to write via smb.
  * For seamless access from Windows Clients use the same username as for your login on your Client. If you use an Microsoft Account to login just use a random username without an @ in the name, "newuser" will work!
  * regardless the filename (which is like this for historic Linux reasons), the actual user passwords are stored separately and will be added in the next step
\\
\\
For seamless access when using Microsoft Online accounts in Windows 8/10, edit ///etc/samba/smb.conf.template// and add //username map = /etc/samba/username.map//:
<code>
[global]
[...]
	username map = /etc/samba/username.map
</code>
Then create ///etc/samba/username.map// which links the Linux User loginname to your Microsoft Account loginname:
<code>
newuser = user@outlook.com
</code>

===== 6. Adding a password for each samba user =====
samba does not rely on passwords stored in /etc/shadows.
By adding the following, you will only enable users for SMB file share access. With these passwords, your users will not get SSH or LuCi access to your LEDE system (unless you give them another additional password in the file /etc/shadows)

<code>
smbpasswd -a newuser
</code>

  * The passwords get stored in hashed form in the file: **/etc/samba/smbpasswd**.
  * For seamless access from Windows Clients, preferrably use the same password as also used for your login on your Client. (This also applies to Microsoft Online Accounts)

===== 7. Restarting samba =====
Reload samba by issueing the following command 
<code>
service samba restart
</code>

===== Optional config: /etc/samba/smb.conf.template =====
In addition to the UCI file (///etc/config/samba//), modifications can be made to the ///etc/samba/smb.conf.template// file.\\
In usual default operation, this configuration can be left untouched.

e.g. to allow users with null password (can authenticate without providing a password), edit ///etc/samba/smb.conf.template// and add //null passwords = yes//:

===== Troubleshooting =====
  * Windows clients: When using exFAT or vFAT(FAT32) as file system on LEDE side for samba, you may experience the Windows error message 0x8007003b on Windows clients >= Win8. This error seems especially to occur when trying to copy large files (> 3.5 GB) to the LEDE SMB share, even though e.g. exFAT is said to support files > 4GB. The samba services on LEDE side may crash afterwards, requiring a LEDE device reboot. The last file copied before the crash usually will not have been copied correctly. A reliable workaround to avoid this error at all, is to use EXT4 on the external drive connected of the LEDE device.
  * If write access is not possible
    * check that the mountpoint (e.g. ''ls -l /mnt/sha3'' has "rwx" bits set. ''chmod'' can be used to change that if in doubt. 
    * check that the samba share is configured with **option read_only 'no'**
    * it seems like if the samba share name equals the mountpoint name that that triggers a readonly mode. E.g. avoid naming your samba share "sha3" if your mountpoint is named "/mnt/sha3"
