====== arc_archs ======

The ARC HS Family includes the multicore-capable HS34, HS36 and HS38 processors. The HS34 is a high-performance cacheless processor, while the HS36 includes up to 64KB of instruction and data caches. The HS38, optimized for applications running Linux, has a full-featured memory management unit (MMU) supporting a 40-bit physical address space and page sizes up to 16 megabytes, giving designers the ability to directly address a terabyte of memory with faster data access and higher system performance.\\ 
All three processors are available in dual- and quad-core configurations.
