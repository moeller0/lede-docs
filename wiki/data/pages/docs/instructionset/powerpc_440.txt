The  PPC440  is  a  32-bit  implementation  of  the  Book  E  architecture  meaning  there  are  32  bits  in  each  
internal  register  and  that  there  are  32  address  bits  available  for  memory  references.  However,  the  MMU  
produces  36-bit  physical  addresses  of  which  2^32  can  be  referenced  by  a  program  using  a  particular  
MMU entry.\\
 
The  PowerPC  architecture  specifies  that  two  levels  of  privilege  for  program  execution:  user-mode  and  
supervisor-mode. In user-mode, access to most registers including system control registers is denied. It is 
intended that most application programs be executed in user-mode so that they are protected from errant 
register changes made by other user-mode programs.\\

Book  E  provides  for  binary  compatibility  for  32-bit  PowerPC  application  programs.  Thus,  existing  
application code, which uses only the instructions defined by the User Instruction Set Architecture book of 
the classic PowerPC architecture, will execute without modification on PowerPC Book E implementations. 
Book E specifies that binary instruction compatibility not necessarily be provided for privileged (supervisor-
mode) PowerPC instructions.\\
