====== arm_cortex-a5 ======

The ARM® Cortex®-A5 processor is the smallest application processor from ARM. The Cortex-A5 achieves better performance than the ARM1176JZ-S™ processor, and better power and energy efficiency than the ARM926EJ-S™. The Cortex-A5 fully supports the ARMv7-A instruction set, and is feature compatible with the higher performance Cortex-A9 processor at one third of the area and power. It is the most mature, most configurable, smallest, and lowest power ARMv7-A CPU, and provides a high-value migration path for existing ARM926EJ-S and ARM1176JZ-S designs.

The Cortex-A5 delivers a range of high-end features to power and cost-sensitive applications. These include multiprocessing capability for scalable and energy-efficient performance, an optional Floating-Point Unit (FPU) and ARM NEON™ unit for media and signal processing, and a high-performance memory system including configurable caches and a Memory Management Unit (MMU).
