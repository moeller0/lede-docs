====== arm_cortex-a8_vfpv3 ======

The ARM® Cortex®-A8 was introduced in 2005 and was the first processor supporting the ARMv7-A architecture. It has enabled numerous mobile and embedded designs and accelerated the early development of the smartphone market and further entrenched the primacy of ARM compatible ecosystem software and tools. ARMv7-A incorporates the ARM NEON™ single instruction multiple data (SIMD) engine, ARM TrustZone® security extensions, and the Thumb-2 instruction set for reduced code size.

Since its introduction, the Cortex-A8 processor has been superseded by the Cortex-A15 and Cortex-A17 processors, but it represents a turning point upwards in the race for efficient high-performance 32-bit compute.

The Cortex-A8 features a 2-way superscalar microarchitecture and saw production deployments ranging from 600MHz to 1GHz and above. It is binary compatible with the ARM926™, ARM1136™, and ARM1176™ processors.
