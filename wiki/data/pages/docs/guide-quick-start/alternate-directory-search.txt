======= LEDE Alternate Directory Search ======

The LEDE download directory structure matches the OpenWrt download directories.

If the Standard Flashing Instructions don't provide the information you're looking for, ask on the [[https://forum.lede-project.org/c/installation|Installation Category of the forum]] or search the OpenWrt site for enough information about your device to find the proper LEDE firmware image. To do this:
      * Find the //Device Page// for your device on the //OpenWrt Table of Hardware// at https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start
      * Find the name and URL of the proper OpenWrt firmware image (factory or sysupgrade).
      * Then go to [[https://downloads.lede-project.org/snapshots/targets/|downloads.lede-project.org]] and find the LEDE image from the corresponding directory.  
      * Follow the flashing instructions on the //OpenWrt Device Page//, if needed.
