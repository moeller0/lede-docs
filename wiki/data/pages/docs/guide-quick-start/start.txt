====== Quick Start Guide for LEDE installation ======
So you want to install LEDE on one of your devices.

The following preparation is recommended, before flashing LEDE firmware:
  * Don't rush the installation, take your time. If something seems weird during installation, find answers first before continuing.
  * Have your device's precise model name at hand (so you are able to select the correct LEDE firmware)
  * Have your devices's documentation at hand, on how to flash new firmware
  * When installing and configuring LEDE on your Internet router, your Internet-access will obviously be offline for a few minutes. Please ensure that you have all required information offline or have backup Internet access at hand in this time.

If you have any questions
  * browse this (LEDE) site, especially the [[docs:user-guide:|user-guide]] section.
  * feel free to ask in the [[https://forum.lede-project.org|LEDE Forum]].
  * you can also consult the [[https://wiki.openwrt.org|OpenWrt wiki]], as LEDE is based on OpenWrt. Both projects shares most operational and installation aspects and some content has not yet been migrated.
