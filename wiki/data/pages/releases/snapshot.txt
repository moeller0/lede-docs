<WRAP center round important 60%>
The development branch can contain experimental code that is under active development and should not be used for production environments. Snapshot images may support additional hardware; however, it is experimental, considered unstable, and sometimes won't compile.

**Prebuilt snapshot images do not come with any web interface or GUI**. You will need to be comfortable using a command line and remote shell to install one yourself -> [[docs:user-guide:luci.essentials|How to install LuCI]]
