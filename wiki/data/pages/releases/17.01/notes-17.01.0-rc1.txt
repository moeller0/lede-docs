The LEDE Project (“Linux Embedded Development Environment”) is a Linux operating system emerged from the [[https://openwrt.org|OpenWrt]] project. It is a complete replacement for the vendor-supplied firmware of a wide range of wireless routers and non-network devices. See the [[https://lede-project.org/toh/start|Table of Hardware]] for supported devices. For more information about LEDE Project organization, see the [[https://lede-project.org/about|About LEDE pages.]]

    * openssl updated to 1.0.2k
  * Improved Security Features
    * Use SHA256 instead of MD5 to validate source code for upstream packages

    * Improvements to the WiFi stack eliminating bufferbloat on ath9k, mt76 and some ath10k chipsets
    * Airtime fairness scheduler for ath9k to prevent slow stations from hogging too much airtime
    * Various stability and regression fixes to the Linux wireless stack and ath9k in particular
    * Provide alternative Candela-Tech ath10k-ct driver 
    * IPv6 hardening
  * Updated toolchain
    * musl 1.1.15

      * ppc44x, disabled due to code brokeness
      * netlogic, dropped due to no available hardware
  * Build system improvements
    * Separation of base system and community feeds to simplify distribution of binary package updates
    * Fixes and enhancements in package dependency handling, better support for virtual provides
    * Per-device rootfs images to better tune package selection to each individual device profile
