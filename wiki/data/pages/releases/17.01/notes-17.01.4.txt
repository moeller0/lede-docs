The LEDE Project (“Linux Embedded Development Environment”) is a Linux operating system emerged from the [[https://openwrt.org|OpenWrt]] project. It is a complete replacement for the vendor-supplied firmware of a wide range of wireless routers and non-network devices. See the [[https://lede-project.org/toh/start|Table of Hardware]] for supported devices. For more information about LEDE Project organization, see the [[https://lede-project.org/about|About LEDE pages.]]

===== Highlights In LEDE 17.01.4 ===== 

The LEDE Community is proud to announce the fourth service release of
stable LEDE 17.01 series.

LEDE 17.01.4 "Reboot" incorporates a fair number of fixes back ported
from the development branch during the last two weeks.

Some selected highlights of the service release are:


  * Linux kernel updated to version 4.4.92 (from 4.4.89 in v17.01.3)
  * [[releases:17.01:changelog-17.01.4#security_fixes|Security fixes]] to //brcmfmac//, //hostapd//, //mac80211//, //toolchain/gdb// and the //Linux kernel//
  * Introduce latest version of the Wireguard VPN software (0.0.20171017)
  * Fix Xen support in the x86/generic subtarget, add Xen support in the x86/64 subtarget
  * Assorted platform fixes for //ar71xx//, //bcm53xx//, //ramips// and //x86//

===About the KRACK attack=== 

While the LEDE 17.01.4 release includes fixes for the [[https://www.krackattacks.com/|KRACK bugs in the WPA Protocol disclosed earlier this week]] in the router firmware, these fixes do not fix the problem on the client-side. 
**You still need to update all your client devices - computers, phones, tablets, cameras, refrigerators, thermostats, light bulbs, and any other device using Wi-Fi.** 
Since some client devices might never receive an update, //hostapd// contains an [[docs:user-guide:wifi_configuration#wpa_key_reinstallation_attack_workaround|optional AP-side workaround]] to complicate these attacks, slowing them down. Please note that this does not fully protect you from them, especially when running older versions of //wpa_supplicant// vulnerable to CVE-2017-13086, which the workaround does not address. As this workaround can cause interoperability issues and reduced robustness of key negotiation, this workaround is disabled by default.

Due to the version bump of toolchain/gdb to 8.0.1, at least GCC 4.8 is now required to build LEDE.

For a detailed list of changes since 17.01.3 refer to https://lede-project.org/releases/17.01/changelog-17.01.4

As always, a big thank you goes to all our active package maintainers, testers, documenters, and supporters.

Have fun!
