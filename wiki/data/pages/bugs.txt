===== Reporting Bugs =====

In case you are unsure if what you found is a bug, or if you have other issues that are not bugs, please use the forum, IRC or mailing list.

Report bugs pertaining LEDE core functionality and device support using our [[https://bugs.lede-project.org/|issue tracker]].\\
If the bug is about a secondary package in the feeds you need to open an issue in the package feed's issue tracker instead. 

If you are unsure, please use the [[packages:start|Packages tables]] to know where you should report the bug.

When reporting bugs please make sure to:

  * Name the tree/revision/version
  * Name the affected device
  * What does it do that it should not do / what does it not do that it should do
  * Steps to reproduce
  * What you have already done to workaround/fix the problem
  * Any additional info you thinks is important

Remember, the better is your bug report, the more likely it is that it will be worked on.

:!: Reporting a bug is important as it raises awareness of an issue, but it does not constitute a claim that anyone has to work on fixing it.
