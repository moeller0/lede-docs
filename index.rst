Welcome to the LEDE Project
===========================

The LEDE Project (“Linux Embedded Development Environment”) is a Linux
operating system based on OpenWrt. It is a complete replacement for the
vendor-supplied firmware of a wide range of wireless routers and
non-network devices. See the `Table of Hardware <toh:start>` for
supported devices. For more information about LEDE Project organization,
see the :doc:`About LEDE <about>` page.

Why use LEDE?
-------------

People install LEDE because they believe it works better than the stock
firmware from their vendor. They find it is more stable, offers more
features, is more secure and has better support.

-  **Extensibility:** LEDE provides many capabilities found only in
   high-end devices. Its 3000+ application packages are standardized, so
   you can easily replicate the same setup on any supported device,
   including two (or even five) year old routers.

-  **Security:** LEDE's standard installation is secure by default, with
   Wi-Fi disabled, no poor passwords or backdoors. LEDE's software
   components are kept up-to-date, so vulnerabilities get closed shortly
   after they are discovered. `More... <reasons_to_use_lede#security>`_

-  **Performance and Stability:** LEDE firmware is made of standardized
   modules used in all supported devices. This means each module will
   likely receive more testing and bug fixing than stock firmware which
   can be tweaked for each product line and never touched again.

-  **Strong Community Support:** LEDE team members are regular
   participants on the `LEDE Forum <https://forum.lede-project.org>`_,
   `LEDE
   Developer <http://lists.infradead.org/mailman/listinfo/lede-dev>`_
   and `LEDE
   Admin <http://lists.infradead.org/mailman/listinfo/lede-adm>`_
   mailing lists, and `LEDE's IRC channels. <:contact#irc_channels>`_
   You can interact directly with developers, volunteers managing the
   software modules and with other long-time LEDE users, drastically
   increasing the chances you will solve the issue at hand.

-  **Research:** Many teams use LEDE as a platform for their research
   into network performance. This means that the improvements of their
   successful experiments will be available in LEDE first, well before
   it gets incorporated into mainline, vendor firmware.
   `More... <reasons_to_use_lede#research_platform>`_

-  **Open Source/No additional cost:** LEDE is provided without any
   monetary cost. It has been entirely created by a team of volunteers:
   developers and maintainers, individuals and companies. If you enjoy
   using LEDE, consider contributing some effort to `help us improve it
   for others! <#lede_wants_you>`_ All of the above is possible because
   LEDE is part of the Open Source community, and powered by Linux
   kernel. `Get the source code... <https:git.lede-project.org>`_

LEDE wants you!
---------------

Like any open source project, LEDE thrives on the efforts of its users
and developers.

-  If you want to develop the software, please refer to our `Developer
   Guide <docs:guide-developer:the-source-code>`_ to learn how to get
   the source code, build it, and contribute your changes back to the
   project.

-  If you're not a developer, you can still help. The documentation can
   always be improved (even if it's to verify that the instructions
   match your experience), or you can help other community members with
   questions. Don’t hesitate to `Register yourself in the
   wiki <:register_yourself_in_the_wiki>`_, or join our `mailing
   list <https:lists.infradead.org/mailman/listinfo/lede-dev>`_ and
   `IRC channels <:contact#irc_channels>`_ to get in touch.
