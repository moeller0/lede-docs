LEDE Alternate Directory Search
===============================

The LEDE download directory structure matches the OpenWrt download directories.

If the Standard Flashing Instructions don't provide the information you're looking for, ask on the `Installation Category of the forum <https://forum.lede-project.org/c/installation>`_ or search the OpenWrt site for enough information about your device to find the proper LEDE firmware image. To do this:
      * Find the **Device Page** for your device on the **OpenWrt Table of Hardware** at https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start
      * Find the name and URL of the proper OpenWrt firmware image (factory or sysupgrade).
      * Then go to `downloads.lede-project.org <https://downloads.lede-project.org/snapshots/targets/>`_ and find the LEDE image from the corresponding directory.
      * Follow the flashing instructions on the **OpenWrt Device Page**, if needed.
