Quick Start Guide for LEDE installation
=======================================

So you want to install LEDE on one of your devices.

The following preparation is recommended, before flashing LEDE firmware:
  * Don't rush the installation, take your time. If something seems weird during installation, find answers first before continuing.
  * Have your device's precise model name at hand (so you are able to select the correct LEDE firmware)
  * Have your devices's documentation at hand, on how to flash new firmware
  * When installing and configuring LEDE on your Internet router, your Internet-access will obviously be offline for a few minutes. Please ensure that you have all required information offline or have backup Internet access at hand in this time.

If you have any questions
  * browse this (LEDE) site, especially the `User Guide <user-guide>`_.
  * feel free to ask in the `LEDE Forum <https://forum.lede-project.org>`_.
  * you can also consult the `OpenWRT wiki <https://wiki.openwrt.org>`_, as LEDE is based on OpenWrt. Both projects shares most operational and installation aspects and some content has not yet been migrated.
